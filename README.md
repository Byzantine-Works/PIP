# The Philanthropic-Impact-Protocol [PIP]
A Decentralized, Fully Autonomous, Blockchain Solution for measuring impact & Delivering on the promise of transparent and true philanthropic impact & Social Impact investments 

# Synopsis
## The Problem
Philanthropists operate in a couple bubbles
- Most don’t have complete transparency to aid disbursement, the execution and verification metrics and impact assessment of the original goal(s).
- Many don’t receive unvarnished feedback metrics from staff, peers, grantees and other stakeholders.

To top it off, most traditional assessments don’t capture key elements of effective grantmaking in support of lasting and positive social change.

As a result, most foundations don’t really know if they could be doing their work better, or how, to support the issues and communities they care about.


## The PIP Solution

- A transparent capital disbursement to the cause and geo-location, through a well defined and curated expert NGO organizations.

- A decentralized ecosystem where the stakeholders and voters have complete control on how the capital is disbursed, results measured, witnessed & impact verified and published for each campaign.

- Using a stablecoin, such as Gemini USD [GUSD], to ensure the token economics are stable and ensures the fluctuations are harmonized and do not affect the impact being executed, verified and measured.

- Each stakeholder in the PIP ecosystem has a transparent access to various campaign metrics, quantitative and qualitative rating measures at the campaign level and individual level.

- Verifiers/Witnesses are incentivized based on their participation in the specific campaign in terms of hybrid curation and verification models.

# PIP & the Platform Ecosystem

- The PIP project encapsulates a native PIP Token as base currency to enable an ecosystem for impact measurement. This platform enables a delegated architecture for executing philanthropy campaigns, verification, ensuring Key Performance Indicator measures are met, and on-chain settlement of aid disbursement and impact result publication.

- The platform is an open, transparent, peer-to-peer delegated economy for empowering 100% transparent accessibility of donor capital, NGO participation, Net disbursements as well as verification and qualitative and quantitative measurement of the campaign impact.

- With a hybrid architecture manifested as iPhone and Android native apps powered by the PIP engine developed initially as EOS smart contract layer,  this will be one of the first consumer-ready P2P philanthropic impact measurement protocol.

## Todos
- Add Synopsis, design aspects esp voting, transparency in campaign-execution, witness/verification process, the ecosystem inner workings, etc for WP articulation, platform design, maintainability & supportability
- Update the constitution once the stakeholders and rewards are well defined
